# Designing and Building Custom Apps using Dynamics 365 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Designing and Building Custom Apps using Dynamics 365 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/design-and-build-custom-app-using-dynamics-365-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788390613), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course demonstrates the new features released with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement. Using the new Unified User Interface, this course uses a sample application to show how to build complex extensions to the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement platform using C# Plugins/Workflow Activities as well as TypeScript generated web resources. 
Starting off, the course makes sure you have everything setup for fast and effective collaborative development and a mature Continuous Integration pipeline using Microsoft Team Services, npm, Nuget & Gulp. This includes automated unit testing of both server-side and client-side code as well as packaging and deploying of your solutions.
It then teaches you a framework for effective data modeling of entities within Dynamics 365 and how functionality can be built up in iterations using user story mapping. 
Learn about base currencies, to ensure that your custom apps do not run into any challenges as they grow in complexity and usage. The logical and physical architecture of integration with external systems is examined using the new Web-Hooks and Virtual Entity features, allowing data to be both consumed and output in a robust and efficient fashion.
The new Xrm client API features of the Unified Client provide exciting new ways of extending your forms and grids which are demonstrated using the sample application being built. 
You'll then learn to extend your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement business applications using HTML, TypeScript, and CSS using KnockoutJS via the MVVM design pattern so that your logic can be unit tested and deployed with easy and effortless repeatability. This course also covers the considerations for mobile touch interfaces so that your feature rich extensions will work on all devices and formats.
